## üéÆ Game Rules

1. Each game consists of 3 rounds
2. In each round, you and the Duck Bot roll a die

4. If both players roll the same number, no points are awarded
5. After 3 rounds, the player with the highest total score wins
6. Use the "Prove" button to generate a zero-knowledge proof of your game result

- **Taskbar**: Quick access to frequently used applications
- **Window Management**: Classic window controls (minimize, maximize, close)

## üîê SP1 Integration

Crisis of Trust uses Succinct Labs' SP1 zero-knowledge proof system to verify game results. SP1 provides a ZK-VM (zero-knowledge virtual machine) that proves programs are executed correctly.

When you click the "Prove" button after a game, the application:

1. Generates game data (scores, winner, timestamp)
2. Creates a cryptographic proof that the game was played fairly
3. Verifies the proof on-chain (simulation or real mode)
4. Provides a shareable verification result
